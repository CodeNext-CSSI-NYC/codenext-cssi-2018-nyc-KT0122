// The rules are that you can only move a disk onto a given tower if either
// 1. The tower is empty; OR
// 2. The disk is smaller than the top disk currently on the tower
// The game ends when all of the disks are on a single tower
// other than the one where they started.

// You should build this game. Here are some tips:
// The whole game can be represented as a 2D array.
// The first row of the array represents the first tower, the second row is the second tower, and so on.
// We will play with 3 disks. They will be represted as 3, 2, 1 where 3 is the biggest.
// The beginning of an array is the bottom of a tower, and the end of the array is top of the towrer.

// So, at the beginning, the game looks like: [[3, 2, 1], [], []]
// Note that the second and third towers are empty at the start

function buildTower() {
  let tower = [
    [3, 2, 1],
    [],
    []
  ]
  return tower;
}

function printTower(tower) {
  console.log(tower);
}

// The game play is just:
// Ask user to enter a "from" tower and a "to" tower.
// Each of these should have a value 0-2, where 0 is the left-most tower.
// When the user enters the towers from/to which they want to move a disk,
// make sure their move is okay by making sure that the disk being moved
// is smaller than the top (last) disk in the "to" tower (or that the "to" tower is empty).
// If it's not okay, ask them again until they enter an allowable move.
// You should have a function that checks if the game is over (which is true
// whenever either the second or third array is [3, 2, 1]).
// Play should continue until that happens.

function movePiece(disk, tower, targetTower) {
  let currentDiskRow = 0;
  let currentDiskColumn = 0;

  //Find the current position of the selected disk
  for (var row = 0; row < tower.length; row++) {
    for (var column = 0; column < tower[row].length; j++) {
      if (disk == tower[row][column]) {
        currentDiskRow = row;
        currentDiskColumn = column;
      }
    }
  }
  //Check around the chosen position
  for ()
}

function findDisk(disk, tower) {

}

// You should console log the array after each move (or better yet, if you want to,
// come up with a nicer way to print out the state of the game).

// You should be able to win in 7 moves as follows:
// 0 -> 2
// 0 -> 1
// 2 -> 1
// 0 -> 2
// 1 -> 0
// 1 -> 2
// 0 -> 2
