// 1. Decrease the variable below by 1 using two different shortcuts.
// Print out its value after each step to make sure it worked.

// Print out its value before and after each step to make sure it worked.

// Bonus: Can you think of a way to double the value of a variable using an addition shortcut? Hmm.... (Note: you would never do this, since readability of code is very important and this would be confusing.)
