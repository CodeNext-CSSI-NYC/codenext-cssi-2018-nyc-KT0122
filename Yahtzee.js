// You must have everything in yahtzee-practice.js working to begin working here.
// Start by copying all of the functions from that file into this file.
// Paste them at the bottom so that you can use them but they don't get in the way.

// 1. This challenge is a bit more open ended. Here is what you should do:
// Roll the 5 dice and show the player the results.
// Ask the player which dice they want to re-roll, and re-roll only those dice.
// Show the player the results again
// Ask again which they want to re-roll, and re-roll only those dice.
// In summary, a player has three chances to roll the dice.
// At the end of these three chances, use all of your functions from the other file
// to inform the player which things they have achieved during this turn.
// For example if they have {4: 4, 6: 1} then they have achieved both a three-of-a-kind
// and a four-of-a-kind during this turn.



// 2. Once you have this working, play the game a bunch of times and see if you can get
// each of the things we are checking for (full house, small straight, etc.)
// The hardest one to get is Yahtzee, which only happens about 4.6% of the time
// after three rolls if you play correctly,
// according to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee#Any_Yahtzee.



// 3. If you want another type of challenge, try showing the results of the rolls
// using ASCII art rather than an array. So instead of telling the user they got
// [2, 3, 5, 2, 1] you could show them using something that looks like
// https://facstaff.bloomu.edu/dcoles/Java/book/chapters/5_decisions/images/dice.png
// This will probably take a while, so make sure you have #1/2 above working first.
